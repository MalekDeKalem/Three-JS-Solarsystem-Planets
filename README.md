# Three-JS-Solarsystem-Planets
You can use the arrow key to move between planets.
This is a Three js Project but it also uses Vite OrbitControls.js and the troika-three-text.
For some reason the node modules didn't got pushed to this repo so you'll have to use 
Javascript package manager npm to manually resolve the dependencies.
oh and get OrbitControls I just got the js file and imported it straight to my project 
as other attempts to import in a diffrent manner have failed miserebly.
